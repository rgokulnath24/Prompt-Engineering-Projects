Build a complete web project for a "Mood Generator" app with the following requirements:

ðŸ”· Project Summary:
Users select their current mood (e.g., happy, sad, motivated, angry) from a dropdown and receive a random inspirational quote related to that mood.

ðŸ”· Tech Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (plain or Bootstrap), JavaScript (optional)
- Backend: PHP
- Database: MySQL

ðŸ”· Functional Requirements:
- User selects a mood from a dropdown
- On form submit, the app fetches a random quote for the selected mood from the database
- The quote is displayed below the form
- Form must validate the input on both frontend and backend
- Use AJAX or fetch to submit the form without reloading the page

ðŸ”· File Structure:
Generate all files clearly with the correct filenames and content:
- index.html
- assets/css/style.css
- assets/js/script.js
- backend/db.php
- backend/process.php
- sql/schema.sql

ðŸ”· Validation:
- Required validation for mood selection
- Sanitize inputs in PHP to prevent SQL injection

ðŸ”· Styling:
- Clean, minimal, responsive layout
- Center the form vertically and horizontally
- Make it mobile-friendly

ðŸ”· Database Table:
Table Name: `quotes`
Columns:
- id (INT, auto-increment, primary key)
- mood (VARCHAR)
- message (TEXT)

Insert a few sample quotes for each mood category.

ðŸ”· Notes:
- Include code comments to explain key logic
- No README or extra explanation is needed
