Build a single-page application (SPA) using React (functional components, hooks) and Tailwind CSS.

General Requirements:
- Fully responsive design (mobile-first, scales to large screens)
- Modern, clean UI with accessible color contrasts
- Soft gradient background and adequate whitespace
- Rounded corners (2xl), smooth shadows, hover and focus animations
- All text and spacing aligned using Tailwind utility classes
- Mobile navigation friendly

Functional Requirements:
1. Include a header with a clear title and short description.
2. Include a simple single-page form.
3. All forms must have real-time validation and user-friendly error messages.
4. Form field constraints:
   - Name: only letters/spaces, max 20 chars
   - Email: valid format, max 25 chars
   - Phone: digits only, max 15 chars
5. Show a dismissible success/error alert that auto-disappears after 4 seconds.

Code & Performance:
- Use clean, maintainable, well-commented code.
- Avoid inline styles â€” use only Tailwind classes.
- Use reusable components where possible.
- Ensure semantic HTML tags for accessibility.
- Optimize for fast load times and minimal dependencies.

Styling Details:
- Smooth transitions for hover/focus states.
- Buttons with gradient background and scale effect on hover.
- Cards or sections should have consistent padding (p-4 or higher).
- Headings with bold, varied font sizes (e.g., text-2xl for headings, text-base for body).

Output:
- Provide complete React component code with Tailwind classes applied.
- Assume Tailwind is already configured in the project.
- Include any state handling logic in the same component (no external state library unless necessary).
