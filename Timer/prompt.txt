Build a modern React.js component called Timer with the following requirements:

ðŸ”· Project Summary:
A simple clock timer that updates every second when active and can be paused/resumed via a button.

ðŸ”· Tech Stack:
- React (functional components + hooks)
- Tailwind CSS for styling

ðŸ”· Functional Requirements:
- Display the current local time in `HH:MM:SS` format
- Start updating automatically when the page loads
- Have a "Pause" button to stop the clock, and change to "Resume" when paused
- Clicking "Resume" should start updating the time again
- Use `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` hooks for state and timer management

ðŸ”· Styling:
- Full-screen centered layout with gradient background
- Large digital clock text with shadow
- Button with different colors for Pause (red) and Resume (green)
- Smooth hover effects and click animations
- Mobile responsive

ðŸ”· Code Structure:
- One single component file (Timer.jsx)
- No extra dependencies except Tailwind and React

ðŸ”· Notes:
- Include clear comments in the code
- Ensure timer is properly cleared when paused or component unmounts
