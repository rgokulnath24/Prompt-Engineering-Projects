ðŸŸ¢ Prompt:

Create a complete, responsive contact form web page using HTML, CSS (via Bootstrap 5), JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL with the following requirements:

1. The form should collect and validate these fields:

   * Name: Max 30 characters, only letters and spaces allowed (no numbers or symbols). Restrict numbers via JavaScript only.
   * Email: Valid format, max 40 characters.
   * Phone: Exactly 10 digits (numbers only).
   * Date of Birth: Required, valid date.

2. All fields must be mandatory and validated on the frontend using JavaScript:

   * Use JavaScript to block number input in the Name field (do not use regex).
   * Ensure email format, phone length, and DOB are validated before submission.
   * Prevent form submission if any validation fails.

3. On the backend (PHP):

   * Use a separate database.php file for MySQL connection.
   * Sanitize and validate all inputs securely.
   * Check if the Name already exists in the MySQL table contacts; if yes, show an error using SweetAlert and preserve the form data.
   * If validation passes and the name is unique, insert the data into the contacts table.

4. UI & UX Requirements:

   * Use Bootstrap 5 to ensure fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop).
   * Use SweetAlert for success and error messages (not default alert() or Bootstrap alerts).
   * Ensure the form looks modern, clean, and centered on the page.

5. Output format:

   * Provide the full code ready to copy-paste and run in server.
   * Code should be well-commented and in a single file (except the optional database.php).
   * Do not return paragraph explanationsâ€”just the code blocks.
